# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info

## üìñ What's a FOSD?
A Free Open Source Device is a new "state of the art" product type for the Roblox Tech community, it's:
 - ### üíº a new way for companies to work together
 - ### üåª free and open source, accessible for anyone
 - ### üß© modular and innovative
 - ### ‚öôÔ∏è made by developers, for developers

## How did it start?
It all started a long time ago, when I (Lxi099), was working on introducing a new modern radio system in Roblox. I created small radio devices within UIs, made them display messages, compass direction, all within a relatively small codebase.

After a while, I decided to get into this project again; I completely overhauled the design and functionality of the devices. I divided it into modules, added a modular keyboard, app loading system, all with the knowledge I gained after developing applications on a [small KaiOS Device](https://www.kaiostech.com/devices/nokia-800-tough/).

And now here I am, working on small, cute, modular and weird 2d devices on a game primarily for children, but with endless possibilities.

## What's this repository for then?
As Indirecta really likes cool open source stuff, we'll be releasing under this repository all the FOS modular devices we'll ever make, organized in folders, with appropriate documentation.
