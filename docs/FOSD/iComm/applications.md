# üè¨ Applications

## Core Apps
Indirecta ships each iComm or communicator device with roughly 6 default applications, these applications are called core apps, similiar to GNOME Desktop Environment's Core and Circle apps.  
This section aims to describe best all the core applications.  
More complex core applications like the Radiocomm app can have their own page.

# üõ∞Ô∏è Radiocomm `Radio`

>Radio-like encrypted messaging app made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Indirecta  
>Allows the user to change frequency up/down 1/.5 MHz, messages are sent in different MessagingService topics depending on frequency, and encrypted with frequency and a key derived from an optional secret using [Indirecta's public encryption algorithm](https://github.com/Indirecta-Technologies/indirectaSEA)  

:::danger

As string encryption is also used on messages without custom keys using their frequency, the Roblox filter cannot be implemented, and we are not responsible for inadequate usage of this application among common game players and unexperienced staff.  
You can GET BANNED from Roblox for using unfiltered chats.  
We have implemented a setting `ExplicitFiltering` in both the Client and Server scripts (both must be the same) allowing game developers to disable all encryption options and techniques that is turned on by default in versions >1.3.7

:::

- Use mouse scroll wheel to scroll, if not available (disabled by group/developer), use the `UP` and `DOWN` iComm Keys  
- When the app is launched, an extension of the status bar (macro title) featuring PTT/Mic status and current frequency
- For developers or advanced users, the custom iSEA String Key option in the freq. menu can be toggled using `LFN`; there is also a debug menu featuring experimental data that can be toggled using `RFN`
- Since the PTT/Microphone message capture technique uses Roblox's .Chatted event, when sending a message using Radiocomm, it will also be shown in Roblox chat. That is why we suggest game developers who use Radiocomm to remove chat history, allowing only bubble chat (your messages will still be seen if you're close, but it's also realistic this way)
- In a recent update, Radiocomm has received support for Roblox's new TextChatService, which allows for messages to be intercepted. Switch to TextChatService for a more suited radio experience.
- Features a configurable secondary unencrypted SOS Frequency that is always received by devices on other frequencies and only transmittable on it's own frequency. By default `112.7 MHz`

# üß≠ Compass `Compass`

- The user is greeted with a red on black selection menu. Use the `UP` and `DOWN` iComm Keys to scroll and `OK` to choose.  The only choice available on the current version is the Applications debug menu. 
- After selecting the Applications menu, the user can scroll using the previous keys or the mouse scroll wheel, and select an application.
- After selecting an application, the user will be able to edit live module "self" data such as AppInfo, Configuration strings and booleans.
- An error simulator tool and a keyboard testing tool have been since added to the debug kit, along with an option that automatically opens the Roblox console
