# ℹ️ Info

Xinu is a Roblox "Server" that can run user-made modules (programs) and provide the necessary scaffold (kernel) for those programs to execute and communicate efficently with the server, allowing the server to use modules, that then output to a screen. 
You can fully customize the hardware, making and distributing computer models and screens. Various models and accesories for Xinu are provided by Pointcove, a close company we are collaborating with, and SafeNet, but you can fully customize the hardware part of Xinu, and the open-sourced components.
