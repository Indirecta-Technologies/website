# ⚗️ Use cases
Thanks to the iComm's modularity, we foresee endless possibilities.  
We suggest using the iComm in any RTECH-product based game, really, thanks to it's encrypted frequency Radio powering safe and secure staff communications,  
maps contributing to forest/deep game navigation,  
and incredible modularity empowering the game owner to customize the iComm to fit any use case, and create their own game-themed applications.
