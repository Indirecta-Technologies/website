# üé® Customization
All iComm design characteristics can be modified, individual keys, the rubber case, antennas, power on button, allowing everyone to create their own experience.
Here are a few examples of what can be achieved with creativity and regular ol' Roblox studio:

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboards
Most iComm customizations will feature a custom keyboard, such as the current official alternative keyboard, inspired by the Unication G Pager Series.
It features a drag and release thumbstick instead of the original DPAD, and colored keys for the software and function keys along with bigger menu and back buttons.

## ‚ìÇÔ∏è Mods
Mods are unique experiences, combinations of different modified components, with different styles and functionality such as application presets.
### Compact Explorer Mod
An almost complete overhaul of the original iComm's design, featuring a modified "Unication G"-style keyboard, larger menu and back buttons, smaller form factor and rubberized edge.  
Intended to be used with geonav applications like maps, compass, sensors, but also games such as conway's game of life, LuaGameboy, etc.

### Rugged Staff Radio Mod
More similar to the original design, this mod features a thicker rugged appearance, matte black color and a more "advanced" boot animation, like the previous mod.
This mod is intended to be used with sec applications like Radiocomm, 2FA, and other authentication apps like the NFC Protocol app or in-house nfc "virtual card" apps.
