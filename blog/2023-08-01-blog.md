### ⚙️ Hello again Indirecta enthusiasts!

This is our second "blog"! We hope you're going to like this new stuff :)

## 🙌 First Indirecta Pixel Event

After working a while on OCF, Pointcove's amazing estabilishment, we've decided to start hosting little update events for our members and enthusiasts alike, we've already hosted the first one!
We demoed pCsi, although we've had a few issues, and showed the amazing iComm install at OCF!

## 🌲 iComm Forest Demo Release

Following the event, we've decided to refurbish our old iFROTG (Indirecta Free Range Open Testing Grounds) game to use as a public demo for the latest iComm revisions, wanna try it out?

## 💻 pCsi Cubicle Demo Release

Just after this, we didn't stop and released our second demo game for pCsi, our joint project with Pointcove to bring a somewhat realistic UNIX Terminal to Xinu!

## 🦾 pCsi Accessories by PIXI

We've created pCsi with Pointcove to spread our love for free open source devices & products. This is one of the reasons this beautiful creation by one of our members came to be.  
Check out this beautiful Xinu server by PIXI Group, you'll see them on our partner wall!
